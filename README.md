# Human Values
I worked as ExploreCSR intern in Seoul National University Graduate School of Data Science. 
In Dr. Joâ€™s NLP Lab, I designed prompts for improving prediction of human values behind arguments. Making changes to prompts using OpenAI API, I conducted research aiming at improving the F1 Score of value classification for Touche23 datasets. 

### File Description
1) value-categories.json has the description of each value
2) result.csv has all the results of Precision, Recall, F1 Score of 10 different prompts
